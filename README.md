# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to continually enhance my skills and knowledge of programming languages, particularly JavaScript. By developing a web-based to-do list application, I aimed to deepen my understanding of JavaScript's capabilities in creating interactive web applications. This project not only allowed me to implement fundamental programming concepts but also helped me explore how to manage user input, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and create a user-friendly interface.

The to-do list application I created enables users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. It provides a simple and intuitive interface that helps users keep track of their tasks effectively. By working on this software, I aimed to reinforce my understanding of event handling, dynamic content updates, and basic web design principles using HTML and CSS alongside JavaScript.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Visual Studio Code to write my code, allowing me to take advantage of features like syntax highlighting and code snippets. The development was primarily done using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of additional libraries or frameworks, which helped me focus on the core concepts of the language.

# Future Work

- Implement persistent storage using local storage to save tasks between sessions.
- Add functionality for editing existing tasks.
- Introduce categories or tags for better organization of tasks.
